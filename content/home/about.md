Hi! This is Luca Viano. Currently Master Student in Computational Science and Engineering at EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.

Previously, I studied Engineering Physics in Politecnico di Torino.

My broad research interest is in Reinforcement Learning with a particular focus on sample efficiency and robustness. I hope my research will enable industrial application soon!
